{"name":"Ferrari F40 Competizione '87","brand":"Ferrari","description":"The Ferrari F40 is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door coup√© sports car built from 1987 to 1992. The successor to the Ferrari 288 GTO, it was designed to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari. At the time it was the fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car that Ferrari sold to the public.\n\nThe F40 Competizione is a non-sponsored, more powerful version of the F40 LM cars that were being raced, which was the result of consumer requests following the order of a French importer who wanted to enter one in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. 10 examples were built, the first two being called F40 LM's, and the remaining 8 being F40 Competizione, as Ferrari felt that the LM tag was too restrictive.\n\nAn F40 Competizione can be found today in the Automobile Museum of Turin.","tags":["rwd","race","manual","singleseater","vintage","italy","#a7"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"700 bhp","torque":"---","weight":"---","topspeed":"---","acceleration":"---","pwratio":"--- kg/bhp"},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","0"],["1000","0"],["1500","0"],["2000","0"],["2500","0"],["3000","0"],["3500","0"],["4000","0"],["4500","0"],["5000","0"],["5500","0"],["6000","0"],["6500","0"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","0"],["1000","0"],["1500","0"],["2000","0"],["2500","0"],["3000","0"],["3500","0"],["4000","0"],["4500","0"],["5000","0"],["5500","0"],["6000","0"],["6500","0"]],"country":"Italy","upgradeLabel":"Comp","author":false,"year":1987,"url":null}
