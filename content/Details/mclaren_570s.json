McLaren predict the model will help triple the company's sales volume by 2020, with UK pricing scheduled at £143,250 GBP, whilst North American pricing is estimated at $180,000 USD.\n\nThe car is to be powered by a new iteration of the 3.8 litre twin turbo V8 engine already used in the McLaren 650S and P1, designated M838T E with thirty percent of the parts redesigned. Arranged in the car as a rear-mid engine configuration, it will deliver 562 brake horsepower (419 kW) through a 7 speed dual clutch gearbox.
