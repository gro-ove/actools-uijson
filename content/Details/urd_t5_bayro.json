{"name":"BMW M3 DTM '12","brand":"BMW","description":"To guarantee equality of opportunity among the manufacturers and to thus ensure both cost control and thrilling racing the DTM Regulations permit any further development of the vehicles after their homologation only within tight constraints. Therefore, the fact that the BMW M3 DTM 2012 immediately proved to be a success model on which BMW Motorsport was able to build in preparation for the 2013 season was all the more important. With great confidence in the car that won all three titles in the DTM the year before the engineers primarily focused on the robustness of the BMW M3 DTM. In a series as fiercely competitive as the DTM the consequences of a retirement are particularly serious. For this reason, the vehicles have to withstand even rough duels undamaged. The BMW M3 DTM is powered by the BMW P66 engine. In its final specification it is made up of nearly 800 different components. In total, this equates to around 3,900 single parts. When designing the DTM power-plant, BMW Motorsport made use of the technological know-how of the BMW Group in several respects. The hightech foundry that is an annex to the BMW plant Landshut contributed the major cast parts such as the cylinder head and the crankcase. Machining, coating and the required thermal treatment of the cast parts were accomplished at the relevant special departments in Munich.","tags":["dtm","2010s","germany","race","sequential"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"500 bhp","torque":"500Nm","weight":"1110kg","topspeed":"270+km/h","acceleration":"","pwratio":"2.22kg/cv"},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","176"],["1000","187"],["1500","211"],["2000","269"],["2500","357"],["3000","385"],["3500","410"],["4000","435"],["4500","459"],["5000","479"],["5500","494"],["6000","500"],["6500","496"],["7000","487"],["7500","459"],["8000","432"],["8500","410"],["8750","380"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","12"],["1000","26"],["1500","44"],["2000","76"],["2500","125"],["3000","162"],["3500","202"],["4000","244"],["4500","290"],["5000","336"],["5500","382"],["6000","421"],["6500","453"],["7000","479"],["7500","483"],["8000","485"],["8500","489"],["8750","467"]],"country":"Germany","year":2012,"author":false,"url":null}
