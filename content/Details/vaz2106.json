{"name":"Lada 2106 '78","brand":"Lada","description":"The VAZ-2106 is an automobile which was produced by Russian manufacturer AvtoVAZ. It was in production from 1978 to 2001.\n\nA development of the VAZ-2103, the 2106 was a four-door, four-seat saloon powered by a 78 hp (58 kW; 79 PS) 1,570 cc (96 cu in) single overhead cam inline four engine of Lada's own design. It used the pistons of the VAZ-21011's 1,294 cc (79.0 cu in) and the crankshaft of the VAZ-2103's 1,570 cc (96 cu in). Though not more powerful than the 2103's engine, it produced more torque, 86 ft·lbf (117 N·m) rather than 76 ft·lbf (103 N·m), making it easier to drive. Top speed was 93 mph (150 km/h), with 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) acceleration in 16 seconds.\n\nIt was also known as the Zhiguli 2106 and as the Lada 1600. The 2106 was “the top of the Eastern Bloc charts for comfort and prestige”, since the ZiL and GAZ-M20 Pobeda were out of reach for most motorists.\n\nIt debuted in December 1975, and “would become the most popular and most numerous VAZ product”. It differed in detail from the 2103, having black plastic headlight surrounds and grille, instead of chrome, and larger taillights.\n\nThe 21061, with the 75 hp (56 kW; 76 PS) 1,452 cc (88.6 cu in) VAZ-2103 engine, and 21063, with the 64 hp (48 kW; 65 PS) 1,294 cc (79.0 cu in), appeared in 1979. (The 21063 would disappear in 1993.) The less-powerful, but also cheaper, 21061 would be the sales leader, helping make the 2106 the top Lada-branded marque.\n\nSpecial rally-prepared versions had up to 135 hp (101 kW; 137 PS) from the 1,294 cc (79.0 cu in) and up to from the 150 hp (110 kW; 150 PS)1,570 cc (96 cu in), while there was a turbocharged sixteen-valve 1.8 liter delivering 240 hp (180 kW; 240 PS).","tags":["rwd","road","russia","manual","vintage"],"class":"road","specs":{"bhp":"78 bhp","torque":"116Nm","weight":"1035kg","topspeed":"150 kmh","acceleration":"0-100 in 16s","pwratio":"13.27kg/cv"},"torqueCurve":[["0","21"],["500","35"],["1000","56"],["1500","69"],["2000","90"],["2500","98"],["3000","109"],["3500","116"],["4000","106"],["4500","103"],["5000","98"],["5500","92"],["6000","84"],["6500","72"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","12"],["1000","15"],["1500","17"],["2000","28"],["2500","35"],["3000","45"],["3500","54"],["4000","62"],["4500","66"],["5000","70"],["5500","74"],["6000","72"],["6500","70"]],"year":1978,"country":"Russia","author":"skip, Buzy_Wuzy","url":"http://forum.simracing.su/index.php?showtopic=1618"}
